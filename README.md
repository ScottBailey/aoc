My solutions for [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020).

My time is limited, some of these are more optimal than others. Most
of the later ones should be in multiple files and some would benefit
by researching more optimal solutions. For example, would the boost
matrix library improve the maintainability of Day 20?

Regardless, all of them were fun.
